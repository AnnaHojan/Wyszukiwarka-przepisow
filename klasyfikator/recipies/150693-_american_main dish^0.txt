brats  this is for the fresh recipe    and is awesome in the original recipe  that led to the thread bra grease  did it last night and am in love  even more with    brats       if you want to smoke them  then add  level teaspoons of cure    i use  prague powder    since i cannot find mortons tender quick locally   and have no idea as to its equivalent        i cube  then grind then spice    mix until my hands are frozen then  get the kids to mix some more  then mix again    until there is no  pockets of spice laying within the meat  i usually add all the spices  except the buttermilk powder to the eggs milk then pour them together  after some serious stirring  i pack into hog casing  then link then  about a hands spread  package about  to the pound  then put in the  freezer if for personal use  or back into the fridge if selling       i also like them simmered on the stove top  in mustard powder  water  and about  onions  then as they start to brown  take them out and  toss on the grill     if i add the hot spices  then i think that id really like them  simmered to firm up  then sliced and added to chili instead of  hamburger meat     but thats another project topic that is open for  discussion     posted to bbq digest by jerry  on jun       roasts salt  eggs   whole but minus the  lemon pepper  ginger  mustard  nutmeg  blade roast or any beef with  pork butt   everything but  mace  milk  powdered buttermilk  white pepper
