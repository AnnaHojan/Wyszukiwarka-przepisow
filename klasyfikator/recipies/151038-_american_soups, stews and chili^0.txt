black bean soup soup oh  and heres a recipe for black bean soup that a friend of mine  made up during her days of being a poor pre med student at barnard   shes now a poor med student at einstein   i first had it on our  camping trips  as its quick and easy  and ive augmented it to my  own tastes  its great with rice  or even spaghetti     saute the onions and garlic in some water in a stickfree pan   once  the onions have become translucent  take them off the heat  and put  them in a pot  large enough to handle about a quarts worth of  fluid   then  add your rinsed beans and enough water to keep them  from burning  and to allow for maximum mingling of flavors   turn on  medium heat  add spices as you see fit  and stir well  this will  bubble some  so if youre concerned about your stove top  use a lid   keep stirring  tho    to prevent the burning on the bottom   its  done when the beans are cooked to your liking  and you like the  consistency  this makes two servings each for a hungry boyfriend and  a less ravenous woman one night  and enough for a lunch the next day     enjoy       ayanna date  thu   jan     est from  ayanna  gaines     posted to mm recipes digest v   by  rfm   on  jan    beans and legumes paprika  garlic  water to taste  cayenne  cumin  chopped onion to taste  clove of garlic  pressed or  minced  black beans  rinsed  chili powder
