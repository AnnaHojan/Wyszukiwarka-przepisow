boston trifle pt  chocolate position rack in lower third of oven and preheat to  degrees  pour  the flour and  tablespoons of sugar in that order into a triple  sifter or sieve  sift onto a sheet of waxed paper  and set aside    sifting the two together disperses and separates the particles of  flour so that when dry ingredients are added later to the batter   folding in the flour is easier and more efficient  requiring less  folding to incorporate  measure the additional  tablespoons and   tablespoon of granulated sugar  set aside     separate the eggs  placing the whites in the bowl of a heavyduty  mixer and yolks in a    quart bowl   a deep bowl this size makes  it more efficient for whipping the yolks thoroughly since it  minimizes the surface area   with an electric hand mixer  whip the  yolks on high speed     for  to  minutes  add the vanilla  and  continue whipping for  seconds to incorporate  the mixture should  appear thicker  pale yellow  and increased in volume  test the  consistency by lifting some of the mixture with the beaters  if it  flows back into the bowl in ribbons that slowly dissolve on the  surface  proceed to whipping the whites  but if the ribbons sink into  the surface immediately  continue whipping until the yolks have the  desired consistency     attach the bowl of whites to the mixer  and with the whisk  attachment  whip on medium low speed     for  to  seconds to  break them up  when small bubbles appear and the surface is frothy   stop the machine  and sprinkle the cream of tartar and the   tablespoon granulated sugar in the center  resume whipping   increasing speed to medium      for  to  minutes  or until the  whites appear glossy and stiff but not dry or granular     detach the whisk and bowl  tapping the whisk against the side of the  bowl with enough force to free the excess  pour the yolks onto the  whites  notice they float on the surface   using just a few strokes   fold the two together with a rubber spatula  dont be concerned if  some of the yolks remain visible  sprinkle half of  tablespoons  sugar over the surface  and fold to incorporate  sprinkle with the  remaining sugar  folding again to incorporate     with the aid of a metal spatula  scoop a third of the flour  and  sprinkle it over the egg mixture  with a rubber spatula  fold to  incorporate  repeat two more times  folding just until incorporated  after each addition     gently pour batter into an ungreased  inch springform pan with the  aid of a rubber spatula and smooth the surface level  bake for  to   minutes  or until the top is golden   the batter hardly rises  during the first  to  minutes of baking  the low oven temperature  allows the batter to absorb heat slowly  so rising is gradual  toward  the end of baking the cake may mound high above the pans rim  thats  fine  as it cools  this dome will contract a bit   when finished  baking  the cake should feel spongy  springing back slightly upon  being lightly touched  a toothpick  inserted in the center  comes out  free of cake  the toothpick is the last test for this cake before you  judge if it is finished baking and remove it from the oven  if in  doubt  baking  to  more minutes will not harm the cake     remove spongecake from the oven  and immediately turn it upside down   positioning the edges of the pan on the inverted glasses  this  position  defying gravity  allows the cake to maintain its spongy  structure without deflating while cooling  cool the cake for  hours   then turn the pan right side up  and place it on the counter  though  the cake is cool to the touch  let it sit for at least  more hour to  cool the inside completely   the cakes structure is less fragile  when cool  making removal easier   to release the spongecake and  maintain its shape perfectly  remove it from the pan as follows   carefully loosen the cake crust that is stuck to the top rim of the  pan  insert a thin metal spatula down   inch  and loosen and free  the crust all around the cake  then tilt and rotate pan  tapping it  gently on the counter to free the sponge from the metal sides  tap  more if it is not completely released  finally  release the spring  mechanism  and slowly remove the rim   youll notice the cake seemed  to have had a slipcover because a thin  crusty layer of cake remains  on the springform rim  its delicious  too   now tilt the cake on its  side  and gently tap the metal bottom on the counter  rotate the cake  as you tap until the removable bottom appears free     continued in part  chocolate cream of tartar  egg yolks  unsifted all purpose flour  eggs  at room temperature  half and half  granulated sugar  granulated sugar  dark rum  semisweet chocolate  unsweetened chocolate  unsalted butter  granulated sugar  cake flour sifted chocolate butter glaze  vanilla  trifle custard filling  vanilla  heavy cream  granulated sugar  granulated sugar  plus
